== Batch Apple ID Creator - thomrburg fork ==

=== Purpose & Features ===

Deploying a great quantity of iOS devices means creating a great quantity of Apple IDs. This script allows automated Apple ID creation from a spreadsheet. Apple IDs are created without a credit card, which is great for many deployments. There is a "dry run" feature to test the script without actually creating the Apple ID.

=== Changes from Master ===

* iTunes 11 support
* Rescue email import support added (see new appleid.csv template for example).
* Last successfully created Apple ID gets logged to Console.app (filter on 'com.enterpriseios.baic' to see events).
* Delays tweaked throughout script.
* verifyPage() removed for iBooks Page. Title doesn't conform to other page titles. Will build back in should it be needed.

=== Testing Results ===

Further testing may be needed before this script is used for production accounts.

LIGHTLY tested on Mavericks & iTunes 11.1. YMMV, but here's the minimum requirements:

* OS X 10.9
* iTunes 11.1.3

=== Requirements ===

* '''IMPORTANT''': Apple uses a velocity check to prevent too many Apple IDs from a single IP address. You must contact your Apple business representative to request that your IP address is whitelisted for a short time.
* Being [http://developer.apple.com/applescript/ AppleScript], this runs only on Macs.
* [http://www.apple.com/itunes/ iTunes 11] is now supported.
* [http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.06/UserInterfaceScripting/index.html UI Scripting] allows us to script otherwise non-scriptbale interfaces. You'll be prompted for enabling this during first launch of the script. Turn on in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility unlock and check "AppleScript Editor."
* Apple has [http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1728 strong password requirements]. Account creation will fail if the passwords are too weak.

=== Instructions ===

A template CSV file is included. Fill out all columns, keeping the column headers, and save as CSV. Then run the script. Rescue email support has been added.

=== Security Questions ===

As of iTunes 10.6.1 Apple has required three security questions. The Batch Apple ID Creator allows you to choose the questions from the list below. Each question should be copied into the appropriate spreadsheet column (Security Question 1, 2 or 3) exactly as typed below.

'' Security Question 1 ''
* What is the first name of your best friend in high school?
* What was the name of your first pet?
* What was the first thing you learned to cook?
* What was the first film you saw in the theater?
* Where did you go the first time you flew on a plane?
* What is the last name of your favorite elementary school teacher?

'' Security Question 2 ''
* What is your dream job?
* What is your favorite children's book?
* What was the model of your first car?
* What was your childhood nickname?
* Who was your favorite film star or character in school?
* Who was your favorite singer or band in high school?


'' Security Question 3 ''
* In what city did your parents meet?
* What was the first name of your first boss?
* What is the name of the street where you grew up?
* What is the name of the first beach you visited?
* What was the first album that you purchased?
* What is the name of your favorite sports team?

=== Known Bugs ===

Errors are not handled gracefully. Although some errors are recoverable, if the script stops, it loses track of its progress. Edit the spreadsheet to continue.

At the end of this script, Apple will send a verification email to the Apple ID. To complete verification, click the link in the message, then re-enter the account address and password.

The rescue email will also be sent a verification email. In practice, it's been found there's no need to verify the rescue email but YMMV.
